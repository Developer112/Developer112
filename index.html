        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>We taught that everyone should have the possibility to make real remixes using mobile devices.  
                Most of the applications are based on the real mixing console interface, with two decks, effects and so on.<br> RemixR has just enhanced the mixing experience.
                With just a few buttons you can add cue points, loops, and many other cool effects, even if you are doing this on a small sized screen, while in other applications you have to try to press the little buttons just to add a loop to your track.<br>
            RemixR is a simple easy to use app that can be used by literally everyone. Having the possibility to create your favorite track with no need for a larger screen on your mobile device, makes RemixR the ideal mixing app</p>
